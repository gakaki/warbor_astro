               <p>Warlbor’s ownership in food & beverage flavours can be traced back to Continental Chemical Society (predecessor of Huabao H & K) - the first national flavour business established in Shanghai in 1912. Continental Chemical Society is the pioneer and founder of the China's flavours industry. "H & K" brand was born in 1947.</p>
               <p>Relying on the strength and technological superiority of the brand "H & K" Warlbor through M & A and its own development has made substantial presence in the sweet and savoury flavours and its products are widely used as value addition in dairy, beverages, baking, confectionary roasted nuts, betel nuts, spices, instant noodles, meat products, snack foods industry, catering and other fields.</p>
